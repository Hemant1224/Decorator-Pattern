# Decorator-Pattern

The decorator pattern is a design pattern used in programming to add new functionality to an existing object without changing its structure. Think of it like decorating a cake: you start with a plain cake (the original object) and add layers of icing, sprinkles, and other decorations (the new functionalities) to enhance it.

Here’s a simple analogy to help you understand:

Imagine You Have a Plain Coffee
Plain Coffee: You start with a simple cup of coffee. This is your original object.

Adding Milk: You decide to add milk to your coffee. Now, your coffee has an additional feature (milk), but it's still fundamentally coffee.

Adding Sugar: Next, you add sugar. Again, it’s still coffee, but now it has both milk and sugar.

Adding Whipped Cream: Finally, you add whipped cream. Your coffee has become even fancier.

In this analogy:

The plain coffee is the original object.
The milk, sugar, and whipped cream are decorators that add new features to the coffee.


By using decorators, you can add functionality to objects in a flexible and reusable way without modifying the original object's code. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to add or combine behaviors at runtime.
